Solar panel return of interest.


[12%, due by Monday, 23-nov-2015]
Final integration of the solar panel ROI calculator
(detect/know location, get temp/sun profile, get local cost of kWh, cost + output per panel,
(Fed + State) tax incentives, utility buy-back,
plot projected cost of solar vs. non-solar over next 25 years
(assume buy-back continues, cost of kWh increases +n%, n = variable)

[7%, due by Monday, 9-nov-2015] Angular (possibly other framework(s)): sync data with database.

[7%, due by Monday, 2-nov-2015]
jQuery, Bootstrap (other frameworks, toolkit, etc.)
easier ways to handle content + look-and-feel.

[7%, due by Monday, 26-oct-2015] Ajax: multi-panel page with asynchronous update of information from:
local temp, sun etc., “solar panel production”,
additional sources (price of barrel of crude? kWh? other relevant data?),
plots.

[7%, due by Monday, 19-oct-2015] Canvas, SVG, D3: draw + plot information.

==========v1.0=========
Issue fixed

Code Refactoring
OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
MVC(model-view-controller)
Use red bean for ORM (Object-Relationship-Mapping)
