Solar panel return of interest.

==========v1.2==========
Weather Monitor: it shows date, temparature, weather type. this data load with
page.
(I think this information should be collected by sensor installed with solar panel
rather than use weather report api,
because the one with solar panel is more pricise.
that sensor should send xml/json with fundamental inforamtion back to server for analysis)

solar Panel Data: it shows solar panel generated power, home appliance's
comsumed power, each day's income. this data does not load automatically.

both above data can be updated by clicked update button.

==========v1.1==========
Solar Panel Monthly Report: this chart show how much electrity the solar panel you owned generated,
how much comsuption your home appliance comsumed,
and total income earned in each month.

Investment ROI Comparison: this chart intend to compare different investment interests,
so you will know which investment interests is highest.

Milestone: this time line chart shows your investment milestone,
for example, when you start, when your investment returns.

Appliance Power Consumption: how much electricity comsumed by your home appliance in different types.

Tracker: I think a person could pontential invest many different project,
say solar panel, stock, real estate.
so the idea of this one is to track different project progress,
you will know what percetage investment you already received.
